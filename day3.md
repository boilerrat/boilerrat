Day 2 established the full **crypto onboarding framework** — a structured educational product teaching safe entry into cryptocurrency. For **Day 3**, the focus is clear: begin **sourcing simplified, trusted content** that supports each module. Here’s your **Crypto Onboarding System – Day 3 Plan** based on the v1.0 framework.[1]

***

## Day 3 Objective: Source Trusted Educational Material

Goal: Build your reference library for writing simplified copy.

### Primary Sources to Extract From
- **Coinbase Learn:** beginner guides on wallets, private keys, and exchanges.  
- **Ethereum.org:** blockchain fundamentals, gas, and smart contracts.  
- **DeFiLlama Docs, Uniswap Help Center, BaseSwap, DexScreener:** practical intros to DeFi.  
- **Bitcoin.org & Binance Academy:** cross-reference explanations for neutrality and clarity.

***

## Day 3 Tasks

### 1. Collect Reference Copy for Core Topics
Focus on short, plain-language explanations of:
- Blockchain basics and decentralization.  
- Token types (coins, tokens, stablecoins, memecoins).  
- Wallet explanation (custodial vs. non-custodial).  
- Private key, backup, and safety fundamentals.  
- How to buy crypto securely (KYC, fees, confirmation).  
- DeFi starter workflows: swap on Uniswap, add liquidity, use dashboards.  

Create a shared folder titled **“Day 3 – Source Copy Library.”**

***

### 2. Build a Content Map
Within the Blueprint document, create a 3-column table:

| Section | Source Reference | Copy/Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Wallet Setup | Coinbase Learn “Set up your wallet” | Simplify MetaMask steps |
| Safety First | Binance Academy “Crypto Security 101” | Include phishing warning |
| Intro to DeFi | Ethereum.org “What is DeFi?” | Translate technical terms into plain language |

***

### 3. Establish a Content Quality Standard
Before integrating content:
- Rephrase everything for **clarity, readability, and empowerment** (avoid hype).  
- Keep tone **educational, trustworthy, and minimalistic.**  
- Each paragraph: 2–3 sentences max, include a visual hint (icon or checklist).

***

### 4. Deliverables for Day 3
Create a new folder/files:
- **Reference Library (.docx or Notion table)** compiling 10+ educational excerpts.  
- **Copy Bank (.txt)** with rephrased simplified blocks for each framework section.  
- **Visual Reference Notes** (list of infographics/templates to match sections).

***

Day 4 will then transition into **assembling the “Crypto Start Kit” draft**, turning your sourced copy into editable slide and workbook content.

Would you like a ready-to-follow Notion or Google Sheet template for tracking your Day 3 sourcing map? It would standardize your content management workflow for the rest of the build.
